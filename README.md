# Arkanoid

Implementing a version of the Arkanoid game, as part of the OOP course I took during in the first year of my bachelor degree.
The game contains various levels with increasing difficulty, in a gui friendly platform.
The game is written in Java language using Intellij IDEA Ultimate IDE, using the following OOP principals:

-Polymorphism and inheritance.

-Usage of basic design patterns in OOP, such as Observer, Builder, etc.

-Usage of several generic collections and data structures such as linked lists and arraylists.

-Working with GUI.
